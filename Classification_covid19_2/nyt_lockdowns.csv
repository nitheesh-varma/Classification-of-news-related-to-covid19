"The CDC made a very hasty decision regarding masks. There was no reason to drop mask wearing indoors in public spaces when it is impossible to tell who is and who is not vaccinated. It has given the unvaccinated a license to stop wearing a mask and yet not get vaccinated. My experience has been that more people in my area continue wearing masks than not, but then NM was a state with an early mask mandate and it may be that people are just used to wearing a mask now. I know I have no intention of giving up my KF94 in indoor spaces anytime soon, possibly forever. Throughout the vast majority of the pandemic we’ve been on our own when it comes to protection. Masks are not burdensome and are a prudent choice. It is still not known how long vaccination protection lasts. It’s not known if the vaccinated spread the virus or not. It is not known if a vaccinated person who gets a mild or asymptomatic case can become a long hauler or not. There are just too many unknowns. I’m of the mindset that I don’t care if others want to pretend the pandemic is completely behind us. I don’t believe it is and I’m going to continue to act accordingly no matter what others choose to do.",False

The argument about personal choice is overblown - choose your vaccine preferences, but we choose who works for us. The number of people with TRUE health issues is so minute, it is worth attention, but not as an argument. It can be managed. I am sick and tired of vaccine ignorance in this country. Too many people holding back are simply selfish, stubborn and ignorant and they have no true convictions about this - push them and they will comply. Also, use shaming, deny access, show proof of vaccine... make it incredibly inconvenient for the vaccine ignorant.",False

My spouse and I are vaccinated, and along with two other neighbors, we help them continue to get food and engage with the world as much as it remains safe for them to do so.
Our society cannot forever sequester those who can't get vaccinated for whatever reason.  When the rest of us are vaccinated, we need to realize that it is the unvaccinated who remain vulnerable.

And now, with ample supply of the vaccine, we’d already be on our way to a bright, healthy, and normal future.

"It does seem, now that I’ve been fully vaccinated and not been wearing a mask, that I still tend to distance myself if just by habit. Wearing a mask again in certain instances would now be much less onerous than it was initially. And I fully expect to now wear masks at times during the flu season, on airplanes etc. For instance we’ve seen what masking and social distancing did for the flu season last winter. Also who’s had a cold lately?",False
"Where I work at a local medical center as a physiotherapist a condition of employment since the Covid-19 vaccination came out is that in order to protect our patients and ancillary workers, all staff be vaccinated unless you have a medical reason not to be. And that any patient who is scheduled to undergo a surgical procedure is required to undergo testing for the virus  no more than 72 hours before the procedure. Also, early on in the process of arranging the surgical procedure the patient is asked if they'd like to have the vaccination or had already gotten one. Point being, is that as a result of this extra scrutiny and emphases on infection control within our medical center, the rate of staff infections from the virus has gone down significantly; as has the suspected hospital acquired infections of the disease within our patient population.

 So to me if we are serious as a nation in controlling this terrible pandemic, not only is greater scrutiny of our individual work environments necessary but so is the responsibility of the individual employer to assure that they are encouraging their workers and management to get the vaccination.

 And finally, among larger private and non-profit corporations, why hasn't the Biden Administration made it a condition of receiving Federal support, that corporations make it a condition of employment for their workers, management and subcontractors to have the vaccinations?",False
"I’m not getting vaccinated. Everyone comments about the greater good but I don’t see many people shouting about the greater good when it comes to homelessness, world hunger, etc. I have every right to decide what goes in my body. People went out and got the vaccine and ate Krispy Kreme and drank a beer. Sounds like they really value their bodies. Also, remember you can’t force vaccinations in other countries.

But more and more, I resent those who are able to get vaccinated and don’t (and that includes some family members). They endanger us all.

"As is often the case with much (not all) of The New York Times' reporting on Covid, the good news -- news that totally undermines the panic and negativity of the headline -- is buried towards the end of the article: ""Several studies have shown that while current vaccines are effective against Delta, they are slightly less so than against most other variants.""  For the authors to ominously frame a piece around the delta variant using language like ""worrisome,"" ""nervous,"" concerned,"" ""fearsome,"" when -- by the authors' own acknowledgment -- the risk posed to vaccinated individuals is apparently only ""slightly less"" than what vaccinated individuals face with other variants is irresponsible and credibility-damaging reporting.  

Reminds me of the alarmism that we saw earlier this year in much of the Times' reporting on the South Africa variant -- where certain authors wrote about ""concerns"" that ""some experts"" had about that ""worrisome"" variant, forecasting a doomsday scenario that never materialized.  Maybe this kind of fear-inducing writing on variants will just have to keep happening in cycles.  There's a whipping up of ""concern,"" and then a quiet petering out -- when the actual data don't bear out the overhyped fear.",False
"This is a brand new viral pandemic and we don’t yet know how it’s going to play out. If vaccine protection is transient or increasingly ineffective as new variants emerge, or if a substantial number of our fellows remain available to keep it propagating, then we’ll need ongoing public health measures for everyone’s protection. We can certainly try incentives first, but at some point there will have to be mandates much like there are for public school attendance. Ideally vaccines will also need formal approvals beyond EUA’s.

We should also remember that some of those vaccinated won’t be adequately protected. People who’ve had strong chemotherapy or take powerful immunosuppressives for autoimmune diseases or have one of the many congenital immune deficiencies (and there are millions) can safely get a vaccine that’s not a live virus, but can still remain extremely vulnerable to Covid. And a small percentage of healthy vaccinees can still get infected. A fully vaccinated Golden State Warrior player recently came out and described how seriously ill he’s been for the last few weeks, and I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. 

Covid 19 is no joke and I have no respect for those who choose to be uninformed and an ongoing threat to their fellows. Try the carrot and maybe we’ll get lucky enough with that. But at some point it’s likely the greater good will require sacrifices or penalties so we can all move on.",False
"I just spent 3 days in Detroit at a conference interacting with literally hundreds of people without a mask or a vaccine. I didnt get Covid. Covid fearmongering is so tiresome. Cases have drastically fallen to the lowest levels since testing was widely available. The Delta variant is more transmissible but there is not a lot of concrete data proving that its more deadly. It has this scary sounding name and gets hyped up by the media, but in reality its just Covid. Im not afraid of Covid, and no one is going to scare me with media hype. As an MIT-educated biologist, I know data. And data shows that Delta is not some new scary thing but rather just another version of the same disease we have been dealing with for 18 months. Sure, its more transmissible. But viruses generally evolve to become more transmissible and less deadly. Covid will do the same. By the time we get to the Omega variant we will have a common cold. Stop being afraid. The media is the virus.",False
"This is a wasted opportunity for companies to step up and help society by mandating the vaccines for their employees (with exceptions for legitimate medical reasons, of course). There are already many precedents for arguably worse invasions of privacy in the corporate world, including mandatory drug testing (ie. urine tests) and intrusive personal background and credit checks during hiring.

In the short term, unvaccinated employees prolong the pandemic and endanger not just themselves but their customers and coworkers as well.

On a broader level, declining to take a free vaccine that has proved incredibly safe and effective in the midst of a deadly pandemic shows a staggering lack of good judgement. If an airline attendant, for example, won't take this common-sense precaution to protect themselves and others, how can I be sure they will make a better judgement call in the event of an in-flight emergency? 

Employees are routinely fired for exhibiting poor judgement in other ways, such as posting an offensive comment online or being caught on video doing something that reflects poorly on their employer.

"@Lily in NY:

Hoping your message applies to fellow teachers, administrators, staff, and volunteers.

Some major school districts in CA, including those that serve large populations of POC families, are good at requiring adults to provide proof of negative TB tests, but refuse even to ask teachers, staff, et al about vaccine status, let alone require vaccination.

These people are paid with public funds and should be required to follow public health guidance.  And since families are required by law to enroll their children in school, they are now faced with the “choice” of breaking the law or sending still-vulnerable children to spend 6-plus hours a day with adults who may not be vaccinated and who may be asymptomatically spreading ever more dangerous variants to children and coworkers and the families they go home to.  

While it appears that, statistically, and so far schools haven’t been sources of many super-spreader incidents, it doesn’t mean it never happens.  And what school employee or volunteer wants the weight of a student’s death or disability, or that of a student’s family, on their conscience?",False

"If people choose to endanger themselves that is one thing; when then choose to endanger others it's a different matter. People who do not vaccinate against covid-19 provide a reservoir of the virus that can drive future infections and ensure the virus is always with us. Viral spread from this reservoir also enables viral mutations to occur, leading to new variants. These new viral variants may be more virulent and may not succumb to vaccines developed for older variants. 

In order to protect the population as a whole, steps need to be taken. If we can insist on insurance for all drivers, the wearing of wearing safety belts, fines for texting while driving, designated non-smoking areas, higher premiums for smokers or those frequently involved in accidents, then we can bring similar tools into play for covid-19. 

For example, vaccination resisters could face higher medical insurance premiums, banning from the workplace, or denial of access to stores and public places, enforced by fines. Resisters would still be free to choose to avoid vaccination, but they would not be insulated from the costs of their choice. They could not selfishly force others carry the burden of their choice.",False
"There is no delicate balance between health and privacy when it comes to virus variants that are much more contagious and deadlier. Those who refuse to wear masks because of no other reason than to be obstinate are essentially playing Russian Roulette with other people’s health and lives without repercussions.

They are not held responsible for anything even though their refusal to do simple things has caused death and devastation to so many other people’s lives. This is plain and simple fact, not something that is debatable. 
All countries of the world should require every person to be vaccinated in order to work in any business that puts them in contact with other employees and/or customers. If you are not vaccinated you should not be allowed to travel outside of your city, enter any government federal, state or local building, business, school, etc. 
Yes, you have a right to decide not to be vaccinated or not to wear a mask, but everyone else has a right not to become infected by you and risk permanent damage to their lungs, heart or any other internal organ or dying because of your choice.

I am sure when NJ eventually allows restaurants to open indoors, (I don’t know if we will allow indoor bars to open before a vaccine), the owners will be happy for a couple of weeks, then they will be pushing for more capacity, which they will not be rightfully given.

In other words, people add a lot of other ""reasons"" into their risk assessment.  Example: I keep hearing how masks helped prevent colds and flus during the season but was it mask wearing during one's probably brief foray into a grocery store that prevented these common ailments or was it the fact that people were working from home, not commuting via crowded public transport (BART in the Bay Area), traveling in plans?  That reality seems more likely to me, not the masks.",True
"Owning an ""essential business"" and having had Covid, I mandated the vaccine for all of the employees working at my company.  The logistics are not that complicated.  I had one of the staff schedule all of the appointments during work hours with a local pharmacy that then confirmed back that the employees had actually received the shot.  One employee was reluctant because of the J&J issue but when it was explained that he would be receiving Moderna and wasn't a woman between 18 and 48, he went also.  One person was given a medical exemption until their doctor confirmed their ability to be vaccinated.  They have also been vaccinated.  Three people had side effects that caused them to miss the following day, but everyone is fine.  Beyond the public health issues which are critical, from a business perspective it is better to lose an employee for a couple of hours or a day because of vaccinations than for two weeks (or forever) because of Covid.  The virus is insidious and the effects of it can be long lasting.  The employees have seen the impact of Covid on some of their coworkers and their neighbors in the area and were grateful that the effort was made to protect them.  If it is presented properly, the employees will get the vaccination for their self interest.",False
"Whether or not it's employees forced to work while they're sick versus patrons with the virus is the critical piece missing here- wildly different policy responses to each. But I'd hesitate before we start pinning this on instant gratification for the young or some uniquely American brand of hedonism. Is there data on this from other countries that reopened? What portion of the cases are tied to outdoor versus indoor dining (common sense says it's a little pointless wearing a mask indoors if you're going to be taking it off for a prolonged period to eat- it's not like we magically stop breathing during the course of a meal) 

And there's also a question of the case load- if it's young people who don't need to be hospitalized and aren't dying catching it in droves from restaurants, to an extent we need to say it's their lives and they're entitled to make their own risk calculations, provided they're not going to the elderly and then spreading it to them. Like people here in Boston are freaking out about the college students coming back but my thoughts are the restaurants and other businesses that cater to them need the business and it's probably better they catch it and stay cloistered in a dorm than getting bored in the suburbs they're from and give it to elderly family members. Better they don't catch it period but there's probably more control over different risk groups in a communal setting like a dorm.",True

To be honest with you, I'm a lot more upset about the fact that we have destroyed this planet, and exploited our resources to the point that this is now happening - that we need vaccines to save us. And yes, it is the responsible thing to do to get a vaccine right now, but what about when the next pandemic comes? Are we just going to keep developing vaccines and injecting things into our bodies?

Personal responsibility goes both ways. If you're going to avoid the vaccine because you believe you have a right to decide what happens to your health, you should take responsibility for paying for any costs related to a preventable illness should you get it.

However there is a more effective way of assuring those who have been vaccinated that it is safe for them to return to work, and that too will achieve a major public service. And that is to get those vaccinated workers to start to think about the virus in a rational way. And that is to explain to them that the statistical likelihood of getting sick from an infection after getting vaccinated is extremely rare and getting seriously ill is close to impossible. 

There have been many people whose view of the virus has been one of irrational terror, as opposed to the statistical likelihood of getting seriously sick, let alone dying, from the virus. These are the young people in good health who have been living in virtual lockdown for over a year or the parents terrified of their small children getting the virus. The people who view anyone who decides not to get vaccinated as ""vaccine hesitant"", as opposed to being a rational decision that they are young and healthy and not at risk of death from the virus.

It stands to reason that if you can effectively trace cases to restaurants, you can trace them to *specific* restaurants. Alert (and fine, if necessary) the places that are identified; closing the entire sector because of 1 or 2 locations is absurd.

The statistics you present in the article are also not being put into their proper context. Louisiana, for example: ""roughly a quarter of the state’s 2,360 cases since March that were outside of places like nursing homes and prisons have stemmed from bars and restaurants.""

Now, over 80% of eligible residents are at least partly vaccinated, our daily statewide case count is in the single digits, and, yes, we finally are taking off our masks in the summer heat and resuming a life much closer to normal. Unless something changes that would warrant a return to extra precautions (a variant that renders the vaccines ineffective, for example, a surge in new infections and hospitalizations) people here are rewarding themselves for doing the right thing. We’ll listen to our state recommendations and Dr. Fauci and carry on. Of course anyone who feels safer wearing a mask and taking other precautions should be free to do so. And under-vaccinated areas of the US should follow the science that applies to them.

I would not be so moralistic about people going to restaurants. Many restaurants are small businesses, often owned by immigrants, which are the backbone of urban neighborhood commercial districts. Supporting these businesses is a positive thing. Restaurants are among the few destinations outside the home in a time when cinemas, concert halls, libraries, museums, and other public spaces are all closed. With the pandemic likely to continue for many months, is it reasonable to expect that people will stay cooped up in their homes indefinitely? That is the kind of lockdown that is likely to produce explosive, unhealthy reactions.

To me, the discourse about unsafe activities is less than logical. Most states (though not California)give churches largely get a free, unregulated pass, even though they have repeatedly been the site of mass spreading events. Restaurants are scrutinized. Many parents demand on site school openings, though these have regularly been followed by outbreaks.

"Intermountain Healthcare of Utah requires all its employees to get a flu shot every year, and that’s only one of the demands it makes as employees and applicants are also subject to random drug testing that includes nicotine, the active ingredient in tobacco. So a private company does in fact have a right to control workers’ off-duty activities to the extent these relate in any way to performance or safety on the job, as limited by any employment or union contract that might govern the relationship.

The issue here isn’t whether firms can, or even should, in general. But the Covid vaccines are still experimental, being given under FDA Emergency Use Authorizations in no way equivalent to the FDA approval that comes only after years of clinical trial information. This isn’t like the well-established flu shots at Intermountain, or the MMR vaccines kids need to attend school. Although I haven’t heard any news suggesting the FDA will decline to approve any of the Covid shots now under EUAs, the idea of mandating them ahead of approval breaks new ground, ethically and legally.

So persuasion is the best course for now. We don’t want to open the door to a nightmare in which people are coerced into receiving an unapproved pharmaceutical that later turns out dangerous. Such an incident would destroy the FDA’s credibility forever even if it weren’t responsible for the decisions to mandate.

Not so.

Real-world breakthrough infections are reported by The Lancet as the following percentages per vaccine: 0.9% for the Pfizer–BioNTech, 1% for the Gamaleya, 1·4% for the Moderna–NIH, 1·8% for the J&J, and 1·9% for the AstraZeneca–Oxford vaccines. In the real world, the odds of a vaccinated person becoming infected are between 1 and 2 out of 100. And when infection happens, the vaccines practically eliminate the progression of advanced Covid requiring hospitalization.

The last unknown, asymptomatic infection, has not emerged among the vaccinated. And, the mRNA vaccines can handle the variants so far. Put all this together with the vaccines’ excellent safety record, and the case for vaccination is overwhelming.

Maybe there are no serious long-term side effects that will emerge or maybe the chance of serious long-term side effects is very low, but at this point it is too early to know.  

I might feel differently about mandating a vaccine after it has already been properly tested over the long-term to show that there are no serious adverse long-term side effects.

"Having been vaccinated and currently WFH but waiting to return to office, I want my employer to require all employees to be vaccinated.  Understanding the challenges of making vaccines a requirement, especially since Trump made masks and vaccines a political issue, the alternative is to require every employee returning to the office to be vaccinated OR receive negative result from a weekly approved PCR test, and answer a series of daily health and social behavior questions in order to get an “approved for office” today. Moreover, vaccines and weekly testing requirements should, in my opinion, be extended not just to return to work but to all business activities, including travel and all internal/external meetings.

My employer is not planning to require vaccines or testing when offices reopen, rather it will rely on local infection data to make decisions, which are lagging statistics. Such an approach makes no sense to me as I believe wide spread return to office requirements without simultaneously requiring employees to be vaccinated will result in increased infections, which will lead to more variants. I imagine others feel like I do... I do not want to return to a life of no social interaction because a breakthrough variant has made the current vaccines ineffective.

First, the recent surge down here --now apparently easing-- is predominantly due to teens and millennials partying.  Closing the bars --obviously a sensible notion -- moved the drinkathons to private residences.

Second, all restaurants are not the same.  Many don't serve alcoholic beverages, ergo they don't attract crowds.  Our occasional recent forays into local favorites have found them virtually empty, otherwise we wouldn't go in.  Easy to maintain social distancing under those circumstances; hard to see how long they can remain in business.

Third, mask usage in stores now seems ubiquitous, a good thing.  I do wish the media would let their readers know a dirty little secret from the contact tracers:  They focus on prolonged exposure --five to fifteen minutes -- at close quarters.  It would help many feel a little more secure about their grocery shopping.",True

There are no other vaccines that are required that do not have full approval.  To compare one of the Covid vaccines (which is EUA) to any other vaccine (with a BLA) like MMR, polio, pneumonia, flu, etc. is not a valid comparison because they are all fully approved.

For example, there are different evidentiary requirements for licensure of a Biologics License Application (BLA) and issuance of an EUA for a vaccine. Furthermore, an EUA expires upon termination of the relevant emergency declaration, whereas there is no “termination” of a BLA.

The corona virus causing Covid-19 is a virus. It requires the same strategies used for any virus-caused disease — i.e., a vaccination if fortunate enough to have a vaccine, barriers as needed following a risk assessment for yourself and others (masks, gloves, distance) and good hygiene.

  The DELTA variant is more resistant to vaccines and spreads more rapidly 60% more transmittable than the ALPHA variant as it  mutates successfully.
  The partially vaccinated  25 million people risk getting of infection is 66% meaning about 17 million people partially vaccinated are going to be infected. 
   Now comes the very serious point for the NON vaccinated (about 1/2 of our country) if and when they will get this highly contagious variant 148 million people will be infected with DELTA COVID or another even worse variant as it evolves because it is.

The vaccines for Covid, however have not been found to be safe by the FDA, its use has been allowed only through an emergency use authorization. 

The FDA explains the reason for its emergency use authorization because 1. Covid 19 ""can cause a serious or life-threatening disease or condition"", and 2. ""the known and potential benefits of the Pfizer vaccine when used to prevent Covid outweigh its known and potential risks"".

So not only was it not approved to be safe, its use was allowed only because the benefit of being protected from ""a serious or life-threatening disease"" ""outweigh the known and potential risks"" of the vaccine.

As such a young and healthy person for whom Covid does not pose a serious risk of a ""life-threatening disease"" is fully within his rights to claim that not only has the FDA never approved the vaccine to be safe, but that since Covid does not pose a significant risk of ""a serious or life-threatening disease"" to him, therefore his taking the vaccine does not necessarily outweigh ""the known and potential risks"" of the vaccine.

""You have no right to infect me or anyone else."" Make it a condition of employment. If the person who is already employed objects, then find them a job where they have no social contact with anyone else. Harsh? Sure, But ""You have no right to infect me or anyone else.""",False
"Virus spreaders have no rights.  I will have nothing to do with people who are not vaccinated.  Businesses have every right to require vaccinations, both for employees and customers on their premises.  If spreaders choose to not get vaccinated, that is their choice and they can stay home.",False
"Here in the UK we have the “eat out to help out” scheme, where the government will subsidise 50% of all diners bills (by 50% up to £20 on Monday to Wednesday), in an attempt to get people eating out it restaurants and cafes again. I believe it is going well, but our “R” rate is going up again a bit! Certainly it is less worrying than “liberating” states!",True
"I absolutely don't see how it's a ""delicate balance."" People need to not endanger their coworkers or the public (if they work with the public). Require vaccination and let people bring notes from their doctor if they have an allergy or something.",False
"I'm all for herd immunity, which is why I got vaccinated. In fact, any sensible person should know that ""back to normal"" really requires GLOBAL herd immunity. Based on the slow vaccine rollout in many countries, I understand the concern voiced by the WHO. That said, the notion that vaccinated people should mask up to protect anti-vaxxers is preposterous--placating senseless rebellion will not get us an inch closer to herd immunity.",False
"My best friend, a cancer survivor, after months indoors, met family for dinner.  The restaurant followed all the guidelines.  She was exposed, an employee tested positive.  Thankfully, she nor any family members contracted it.

Almost once weekly an exposure potential is on my local news.  Always an employee at a restaurant testing positive.   

My favorite local restaurant, sadly just permanently closed. 

No I will not eat at a restaurant for a very long time.  

I am still working, I would love to see my best friend, but I consider it too great a risk to take with her impaired immune system.  

We are all missing our normal lives, but a little sacrifice can save so many lives.  Wear a mask, keep your distance.",True
"My 20 year old daughter went back to work at a Restaurant in June as a cashier during the week. On the weekends they had her sitting outside doing curbside. She had numerous old men refuse to wear masks, they would try to demand she take hers off before they paid, she refused. On July 12 th she lost her sense of taste and smell. On the 15 the she was tested for Covid-19. The following Sat she had a 102.7 fever , the next Sunday she was called and told she is positive. She has been ER sick but not admitted. She cannot seem to get any better.  

Did one of those old red hat wearing men that refused to wear a mask that spread it to her, end up on a vent?",False
"The other day, I was at urgent care for one thing, but the doctor unexpectedly recommended a small procedure on my ear.  He called in a medical assistant.  She ended up taking twenty minutes, a foot from my face, talking half of the time.  It occurred to me late in the game to ask her whether or not she'd had an opportunity to get vaccinated.  Yes, she'd been offered it, but no, she didn't like the idea of Covid vaccines. My first thought was ""Yikes"" (but in language I can't use here), and my second thought was that people shouldn't work in the medical field if they don't have a modicum of belief in medical science.

It's a special kind of betrayal when you go in to take care of your health, and are exposed to medical personnel who may UNnecessarily endanger it!  Covid Vaccination MUST to be required of everyone working in a medical setting.  If not now, then post-FDA approval at the latest.",False
"As part of Covid relief and economic stimulus, I wish government could tap restauranteurs to make and deliver food to all who need it but cannot pay (as part of the public safety net.) Restaurants are able to purchase, prepare, and store food at scale; I bet Tom Colicchio (as an example) could employ and train a lot of prep cooks, sous chefs, and kitchen help to turn out delicious and healthy food for the entire tri-State area! Special dietary restrictions? Restaurants have already solved that complexity. There’s no need for restaurants to go under while people are hungry and food goes to waste. One solution could end a triple shame.",False
"Again, if insurance companies say they will not cover employees or those costs incurred as a result of hospitalization from covid because they who refused to get the vaccine things will change. Covid is not a pre existing condition initially so it would seem this is within the insurance companies rights. I would support them in such an endeavor. Vaccines work. That is the bottom line.",False
"I went out for lunch yesterday with a friend. It is the second time I've been out just for fun since March. Both times, my friend and I ate at a restaurant that served us seated outside.  That will not be an option when the weather gets cold. 

I am extremely frustrated by the Trump inspired crowd who believe it is their god given right to not wear a mask. They and their lunacy are destroying this nations credibility. We are considered a major health risk by the rest of the world. 

Currently U.S. citizens with an American passport are allowed to enter only EIGHT countries without any restrictions. There are 23 other countries that’ll let some of us in – but with restrictions and quarantines.",False
"Even a year and a half later, I don't understand at all why people object to such a small thing as wearing a mask. I'm finally about to get my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine next week, after waiting patiently through our rollout and prioritization of vulnerable groups, slowed by limited vaccine supply in the early months. I have been separated for eighteen months from my partner, who is caregiving for a parent in Europe, so believe me the wait has been grueling. I am grateful and thrilled to be getting my second dose - thank you to science and public health, and now loosened export restrictions, providing us with sufficient supply north of the border - but will continue to wear a mask in enclosed spaces for the foreseeable future. It's such a small thing that I can do for others, full stop. I really just don't understand why this is even a debate.",False
"Let me get this straight. Vaccinated people are supposed to go back to wearing masks, even though they are not getting significant symptoms even when infected, to guard against a theoretical risk that they could pass it to people who chose not to vaccinate? Good luck with that.",False
"I have not suffered from a cold or the flu for over a year now.  Hence, I will always wear a mask when I am around lots of people in an enclosed space---stores, crowded sidewalks and such.",False
I cannot understand why people are still standing in lines today.  There should be an app that lets you log in and will alert you when your turn is up. That way you can easily social distance while waiting.  A pretty simple solution that helps.,False
